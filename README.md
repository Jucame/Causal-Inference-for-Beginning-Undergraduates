# Causal-Inference-for-Beginning-Undergraduates
An introductory course on causal inference. Designed for undergraduate students with only a working knowledge of R, statistical theory and multiple regression. The course is as light as possible on maths, but heavy on intuition and practical examples. The aim is to explain both the statistical theor but also the practicalities and ideas behind causal researh designs. Students should be equiped to design their own studies and to critique existing papers.
This repository contains lecture notes, as well as computer exercises in R with solutions and datasets, for a ten-week course covering experiments, matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences and synthetic control.
Note that lectures 2-4, and some of 6, are designed to be read alongside Gerber and Green's "Field Experiments" textbook and occasionally reproduce equations from the book.
