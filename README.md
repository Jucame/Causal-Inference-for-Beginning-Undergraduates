# Causal-Inference-for-Beginning-Undergraduates
An introductory course on causal inference. Designed for undergraduate students with only a working knowledge of R and multiple regression. Light on maths, heavy on intuition and practical examples.
This repository contains lecture notes, as well as computer exercises in R with solutions and datasets, for a ten-week course covering experiments, matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences and synthetic control
