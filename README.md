# Causal-Inference-for-Beginning-Undergraduates
An introductory course on causal inference. Designed for undergraduate students with only a working knowledge of R and multiple regression. Light on maths, heavy on intuition and practical examples.
This repository contains lecture notes, as well as computer exercises in R with solutions and datasets, for a ten-week course covering experiments, matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences and synthetic control.
Note that lectures 2-4, and some of 6, are designed to be read alongside Gerber and Green's "Field Experiments" textbook and occasionally reproduce equations from the book.
