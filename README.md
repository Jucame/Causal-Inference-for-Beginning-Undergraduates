# Causal-Inference-for-Beginning-Undergraduates
An introductory course on causal inference. Designed for undergraduate students with only a working knowledge of R, statistical theory and multiple regression (i.e., 1-2 semesters of a standard sequence). The course is as light as possible on maths, but heavy on intuition and practical examples. The aim is to explain both the statistical theory but also the practicalities and ideas behind causal researh designs. Students should be equiped to design their own studies and to critique existing papers. The examples are drawn primarily from economics and political science, with a little epidemiology thrown in too.

This repository contains lecture notes, as well as computer exercises in R with solutions and datasets, for a ten-week course covering experiments, matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences and synthetic control. The weekly exercises almost all involve students replicating results from well-known papers that use the techniques. I've provided worksheets (problem sets) as well as solutions and code for R. At some point I will get round to setting these up properly in R Markdown! The R code is mostly at a very introductory level and therefore suitable for those with minimal background in R. For instance, I do not use Tidyverse for this course.

Note that lectures 2-4, and some of 6, are designed to be read alongside Gerber and Green's "Field Experiments" textbook and occasionally reproduce equations from the book. Lectures 8 and 9 also contain some diagrams that were originally made by Teppei Yamamoto for a similar module at MIT.
